# Appearance

Myne has golden eyes and midnight blue hair[1]. Because her hair is straight and silky, she uses a wooden hairpin to twist the upper half into a bun, while the rest falls loosely to her lower back[2].. After Myne begins using rinsham, others often comment on how glossy her hair looks[3].

Because of her poor constitution, Myne spent little time outside as a child and has sickly pale skin[4]. Her illness also stunts her growth, causing others to mistake her for a child several years younger than her true age[2].
